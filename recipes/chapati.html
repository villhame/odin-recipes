        Many South Asian nations, including India, Pakistan, and Nepal, are fond of the flatbread known as chapati. It is created with a blend of wheat flour and water, and it occasionally also contains yoghurt, salt, and oil. The dough is formed into thin rounds, which are then cooked on a griddle or in a skillet until they puff up and get a little browned.

        It is a staple cuisine in those nations and is frequently offered as a side dish with curries and other savoury foods. A chapati can be used as a utensil to scoop up food, much like a fork or spoon. It is a conventional dish that is rather simple to prepare, inexpensive, and healthy.

    <h3 id="bigtext">Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul class="mylist">
            <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¾ cup hot water or as needed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 id="bigtext"> Steps: </h3>
    <ol class="mylist">
        <li>
            Mix flours and salt in a large bowl. Use a wooden spoon to stir in water and olive oil. Mix until a soft, elastic dough forms and add more water, if needed. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide dough into 10 equal portions, or less if you want larger chapatis. Roll each piece into a ball and let rest for a few minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a lightly greased skillet over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a rolling pin to roll dough balls out on a lightly floured surface until very thin, like a tortilla.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the skillet starts to smoke, place a chapati in it. Cook until bottom has brown spots, about 30 seconds, then flip and cook 30 seconds more. Repeat to cook remaining chapatis.
        </li>
    </ol>
